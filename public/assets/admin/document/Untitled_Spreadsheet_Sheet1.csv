The non-profit organization Riverview Jazz was formed, and in a few short years, the organization was producing up to 100 jazz events a year and all free to the public. In 2019, the yearly Riverview Festival was renamed the Jersey City Jazz Festival and drew a crowd of 30,000 attendees, making it one of the largest jazz festivals in the NYC tri-state area. Thanks to our generous donors and sponsors, we have now secured our current home, the Exchange Place waterfront, and are excited to present the most extensive festival line-up for 2024."
